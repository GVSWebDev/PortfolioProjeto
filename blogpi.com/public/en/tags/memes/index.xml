      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best memes of 2020. Period.
Why does it exist? Why did something like that become a meme? Nobody knows. But something about this introduction to a bootleg game made for the Brazilian market and developed by a Peruvian company is too funny for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Ronaldo&amp;rsquo;s sarcastic laugh (?), Along with a possibly Peruvian person speaking a Brazilian name and an English word in quick succession.
Perhaps the soundtrack, that the more you hear, the more you want to hear. Something tells me that we&amp;rsquo;ll never know for sure &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
