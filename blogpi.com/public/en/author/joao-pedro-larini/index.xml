      <description>Interested in computing from an early age, I always seek to update myself on new types of technology, both for professional use how much staff. I have complete courses in the area of servers, technical maintenance and hardware theory. Currently studying science computing. I participated in several lectures discussing innovations proposed by companies like Amazon, Sotran, Google and others. I intend to professionalize in the area of servers and database and provide services reported to the area.</description>
