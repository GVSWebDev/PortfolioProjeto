      <description>Currently studying Computer Science, I usually research on the subject since I was a child, in order to facilitate everyday tasks. I am interested in the area of ​​information security, cryptography, social structure and malware, I believe that the area is currently little known and deserves greater attention, given the importance that information manipulation has over other areas. I intend to continue my studies on systems structures and be able to add as much information to the IT community.</description>
