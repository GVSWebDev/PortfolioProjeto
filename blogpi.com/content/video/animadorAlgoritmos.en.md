A very interesting project that I worked with Jo√£o was the project of the algorithm animator, which we did in the discipline Computer Laboratory II of professor Ricardo Inacio.

In the video above, I demonstrate how this program works, and also mention the difficulties encountered along the way.

In it, we had the task of finishing writing a program that aims to show the functioning of the ordering and search algorithms that we previously learned in the same subject.

We programmed the logic of the graphics system, where the design of each one adapted to the list that was given as a parameter. No matter the size of the list or its elements, the program processed this information and displayed it correctly on the panel.

We also programmed the chart's color system, so that all the 'movements' that the program made with the lists were recorded and added as 'frames' in the animator.
After that, we also had to implement the algorithms, and record all the movements of the list at each step of the operation, in order to facilitate the understanding of their operation.
