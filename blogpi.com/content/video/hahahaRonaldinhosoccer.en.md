One of the best memes of 2020. Period.
Why does it exist? Why did something like that become a meme? Nobody knows. But something about this introduction to a bootleg game made for the Brazilian market and developed by a Peruvian company is too funny for me.

Perhaps Ronaldo's sarcastic laugh (?), Along with a possibly Peruvian person speaking a Brazilian name and an English word in quick succession.
Perhaps the soundtrack, that the more you hear, the more you want to hear. Something tells me that we'll never know for sure ...
