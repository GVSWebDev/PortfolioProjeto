Interested in computing from an early age, I always seek to update myself on new types of technology, both for professional use
how much staff. I have complete courses in the area of servers, technical maintenance and hardware theory. Currently studying science
computing. I participated in several lectures discussing innovations proposed by companies like Amazon, Sotran, Google and others.
I intend to professionalize in the area of servers and database and provide services reported to the area. I am a proactive person who always
seeks to learn more about subjects that can provide me with new methods to accomplish other tasks.
