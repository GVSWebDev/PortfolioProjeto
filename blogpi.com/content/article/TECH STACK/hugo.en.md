To start building the blog, we selected a Static Gen (Static Site Generator) called Hugo, its function is to serve as the basis for a customizable theme.
Together with Hugo, we installed a theme called Billburry, the theme deals with the visual part of the blog, while Hugo with the code part. Hugo has a server
internal, using it we can generate a "preview" with the changes we made to the theme, after making considerable changes, we send the changes to our
repository on GitHub.
