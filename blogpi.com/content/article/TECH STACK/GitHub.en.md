GitHub is a platform in order to version projects, it is possible to create repositories and store files (of projects for example) in them. Main
reason for using GitHub for us was the possibility for all of us to work on the same project and facilitate the joining of our progress. If someone does
any modification to any file, everyone in the group will also have this modification, as the local files are linked to the repository.
