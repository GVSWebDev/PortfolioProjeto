The Amazon AWS service has several features, we used the EC2 Manager system, this system will "run" a virtual machine with an operating system
of our choice. We use the Amazon EC2 operating system (a Linux distribution from Amazon itself). The EC2 Manager itself has a control panel outside the
virtual machine, through it we configure the firewall to have access to the machine outside the local network. After that we installed an application called Apache to "host" the blog.
