In my second year of the computer science course, my colleagues and I received an assignment for an indiplinary project that insisted on creating and versioning a portfolio site - which, oddly enough, is the one I'm posting this message hehe -, until this At the time of the championship I had never even thought about what steps were taken to create a website.
therefore, my colleagues and I went out to research and follow the tips that our advisors gave us, where to look and how a website works. We hired an AWS host service and loaded linux on this virtual machine, I was particularly in charge of posting and informing about updates and settings on the site - which, by the way, was the one that took the photo of the group hehe -.
Honestly I had no idea how to version a site before this task, I believe that after that I will test it with other sites and other themes and platforms.
