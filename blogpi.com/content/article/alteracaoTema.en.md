We modified the Bilburry theme to better accommodate our project, the theme itself doesn’t have the buttons on the main tab,
we implemented them using HTML and SASS to make the types of post we create more organized, we also changed the options
from standard languages ​​that are English and German to Portuguese (standard) and English. When the English option is clicked, the site
loads an English version of the posts.
To accommodate the new menu, it was also necessary to create mediaquery rules in SASS so that the page
still be responsive and adapt to the size of the window. On mobile screens, the menu is hidden and located
in the nav menu, located at the top of the page and can be opened by the hamburger button.

The width of the site was also modified because we felt that the original width was a little narrow. The circle containing the team photo
had its size increased so that the image was clearer.
The main colors of the website have also undergone a slight change, but we will still try other options to see which one will taste
general.
