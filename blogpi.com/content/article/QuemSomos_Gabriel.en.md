Introduced in the world of computers and games since I was 6 years old, computing has been a great passion for me since I was little.
The curiosity to know how the games worked led me to the programming path. In 2013, the Java language was introduced
to make a modification of the best game of the time, Minecraft. In the years that followed, I explored more languages ​​like C # to
use on Unity, which is a game engine that was starting to become popular at the time. In 2016, I decided to take a training course
IT at CityComputer. I took classes in programming concepts, Visual Basic, database, C # and a little 3D modeling.
From then on, I had several game projects that were not completed due to the great complexity and lack of experience.
In 2018, I was discouraged by the dream of becoming a game programmer, but in return I discovered another area that interested me, Web Development.
I taught myself the basics of Front-End, being HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I also took courses online at freeCodeCamp to reinforce. After arriving in
As an intermediate level of static websites, I started to be interested in the Back-End and started to learn PHP and MySQL.
some website projects, like CSGO Fetch, which served to see the statistics of your CS: GO correspondence or also
a website for car dealerships. These projects were not used and only served to improve my knowledge.
In 2019, I joined the Computer Science course at Unifil, in the middle of the year. I am learning several concepts that gave
a definite one in my skills.
